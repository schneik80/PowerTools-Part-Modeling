# Timeline Compute Times

[Back to Readme](../README.md)

## Description

For the active document, if it is a timeline design, Display a report for feature compute times.

Rows/Features are sorted by compute time.

Rows include the component the feature applies to, the feature name, the time to compute in seconds and the health of the feature.

This tool is useful for identifying which features may be contributing unusual long times to model rebuilding.

Note: the source compute time data is also exported as CSV to your temp directory.

## Access

Access to the **Timeline Compute Report** is from the Design Document's **Utilities** tab, In the **Tools** panel.
